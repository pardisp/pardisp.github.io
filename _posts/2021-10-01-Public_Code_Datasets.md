title: Public Datasets for Code Understanding Tasks
tags: code-understanding ml4code
---

Labeled data is typically scarce for code-understanding tasks, both for training and evaluation purposes. In this post, I share a number of datasets that ML/SE researchers have collected and (kindly) shared. I will keep this post up-to-date as I find new datsets. Please email me if some dataset is missing.
