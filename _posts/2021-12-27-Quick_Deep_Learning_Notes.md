A few months ago, I started exploring Deep Learning and relevant tools.
I wanted to learn the math behind each concept (in a non-scary manner) in addition to the intuitions. Also, I wanted to become proficient in PyTorch. So I had to look up different sources for each topic. I decided to share some of these (hand-written) notes in case somebody is looking for fast-paced yet A-to-Z tutorials on Deep Learning and PyTorch.
Although typing all the notes is a thing now, I still prefer hand-written notes. So, please excuse my scribbles and doodles!
