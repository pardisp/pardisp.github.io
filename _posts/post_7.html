<p style="font-weight: 200">
When I started exploring deep learning, I had to look up different sources for each topic; there are so many of them. Now that I have come to a conclusion about sources that work for me, I share some of these (hand-written) notes in case somebody is looking for fast-paced yet A-to-Z tutorials on Deep Learning and PyTorch.
Although typing all the notes is a thing now, I still prefer hand-written notes. So, please excuse my scribbles and doodles!
