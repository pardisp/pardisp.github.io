  - title: "Chisel:  Automated system for debloating and customization of C/C++ programs"
    desc: "The widespread practice of code reuse and the one-size-fits-all approach to software engineering have resulted in significant and widespread increases in the size and complexity of software, resulting in decreased performance and security vulnerabilities. Programmers can use Chisel to customize and debloat their programs effectively. It takes as input a program to be debloated as well as a high-level specification of its desired functionality. The output is a reduced version of the program that conforms to the specification. CHISEL significantly improves upon existing systems for reducing programs by utilizing a novel, reinforcement learning-based approach to finding the reduced program, as well as scalability to large programs. Evaluation of real C programs shows that Chisel successfully removes all unwanted functionalities and reduces attack surfaces. Compared to two state-of-the-art program reducers <a href=\"https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/\">c-reduce</a> and <a href=\"https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/publications/perses.pdf\">Perses</a>, it runs up to 7.1x and 3.7x faster."

  - title: "ChiselBench:  Benchmark for evaluating source-level debloating systems"
    desc: "The ChiselBench collection consists of more than ten programs, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils\">GNU Core Utilities</a> package. These programs were chosen based on their open-source nature and widespread use. It is interesting to note that their manually-reduced implementations are available in <a href=\"https://github.com/mirror/busybox\">BusyBox</a>, a lightweight UNIX utility package for embedded Linux. In designing ChiselBench, the main objective was to open up avenues for researchers to examine program debloating."

  - title: "PMBench:  Benchmark for evaluating package-level debloating systems"
    desc: "The PMBench application suite provides 10 widely-used Debian applications spanning two domains: 1. Linux command-line tools such as wget that use the standard Linux development philosophy of focusing on one thing and doing it well; and 2. well-known graphical user applications such as firefox, which are widely used by both casual and expert users alike. In addition to their extensive feature sets and large number of dependent packages, these applications have ample space for security improvements through package-oriented debloating. The test suite contains a large number of test cases corresponding to beginner, expert, and common user scenarios, in addition to a list of <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/\">CVE</a> IDs for each package. A primary objective of PMBench is to provide researchers with a framework for researching program debloating at a large scale."

  - title: "DoStbin:  Data model for describing experiments involving denial-of-service attacks"
    desc: "DoStbin is composed of two components - 1. A data model for describing Denial-of-Service (DoS) experiments and mitigation strategies, and 2. a catalogue of results for experiments conducted using DoSarray. The experiments help to better understand how systems can be protected against such attacks. DoStbin was developed as part of DeDOS research at the University of Pennsylvania."

  - title: "Flowdar:  Visualizing how computer programs work"
    desc: "Flowdar is a comprehensive toolset for understanding how computer programs operate. It provides insight into the flow of control and data, as well as the utilization of resources by the application. In Flowdar, traces are generated during program execution and then analyzed off-line. The trace can be configured to contain the amount of detail you desire. The less information you require, the less overhead you encounter. Find out more by reading our paper on Flowdar."
