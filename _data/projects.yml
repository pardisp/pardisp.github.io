  - title: "Chisel:  Automated system for debloating and customization of C/C++ programs"
    desc: "Prevalent software engineering practices such as code reuse and the one-size-fits-all methodology have contributed to significant and widespread increases in the size and complexity of software, resulting in decreased performance and increased security vulnerabilities. We Chisel to enable programmers to effectively customize and debloat programs. Chisel takes as input a program to be debloated and a high-leve specification of its desired functionality. The output is a reduced version of the program that is correct with respect to the specification. Chisel significantly improves upon existing program reduction systems by using a novel reinforcement learning-based approach to accelerate the search for the reduced program and scale to large programs. Our evaluation on real C programs demonstrates that Chisel successfully removes all unwanted functionalities and reduces attack surfaces.  Compared to two state-of-the-art program reducers <a href=\"https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/\">c-reduce</a> and <a href=\"https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/publications/perses.pdf\">Perses</a>, it runs up to 7.1x and 3.7x faster and finishes on all programs."

  - title: "ChiselBench:  Benchmark for evaluating source-level debloating systems"
    desc: "ChiselBench is a suite of 10 programs (and counting) from GNU packages including <a href=\"https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils\">GNU Core Utilities</a>. These programs were chosen since they are open-source and widely used. More interestingly, their manually-reduced implementations are available in <a href=\"https://github.com/mirror/busybox\">BusyBox</a>, a lightweight UNIX utility package for embedded Linux. The main objective of designing ChiselBench is to pave the path for researchers to explore program debloating."

  - title: "PMBench:  Benchmark for evaluating package-level debloating systems"
    desc: "PMBench is a suite of 10 wisely-used Debian applications selected from two domains -- 1. Linux command-line tools such as wget that usually have a small number of features by following the standard Linux development philosophy *do one thing well*; and 2. popular graphical user applications such as firefox that are widely used by both casual and expert users. These applications have bountiful feature sets with a large number of dependent packages, and thereby have ample room for security improvements through package-oriented debloating. The suite contains a large number of test cases covering beginners', experts', and common users' scenarios as well as the list of <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/\">CVE</a> IDs that correspond to individual packages. The main objective of curating PMBench is to pave the path for researchers to explore program debloating in scale."

  - title: "DoStbin:  Data model for describing experiments involving denial-of-service attacks"
    desc: "DoStbin consists of two parts -- 1. a data model for describing experiments involving Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and mitigations, and 2. an archi e of results for DoS experiments done using DoSarray. These experiments serve to better understand how to defend systms against such attacks. DoStbin emerged from research carried out at the University of Pennsylvania as part of the DeDOS project."

  - title: "Flowdar:  Visualizing how computer programs work"
    desc: "Flowdar is an extensively documented toolset for understanding how computer programs work. In particular, it helps understand the flow of control and data, and understand resource usage by the application. Flowdar works by generating a trace while the program is running, and then analysing the trace off-line. You can configure how much detail you want the trace to contain -- the less information you need, the less overhead is required to produce that information. Find out more by reading our paper on Flowdar."
